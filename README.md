Welcome to the Stock Portfolio Simulator! This project is a basic stock portfolio simulator built using Python, Flask, SQLite, and the CEX API for fetching real-time stock prices. It serves as a platform to explore API requests, practice web development with Flask, and gain a basic understanding of stock market investing.
